# analytics-data-scientist-exercise

Welcome to the recruitment task for the Senior Data Scientist position in the Analytics team at ICEYE! 

In this repository you will find all the necessary instructions to complete the three different exercises that we ask you to 
complete. 

In case that there is any question concerning the lack of comprehension of the exercise instructions we encourage you to reply to your recruitment contact person from ICEYE. However, we kindly ask you to please refrain from any questions that
have to do with the approach that you are taking to solve the exercises as this will be discussed on a later stage in the
interview process if suitable. We are most interested in how you approach problems, so your demonstration of this is very valuable to us.

Please try to limit your time to now more than 3 hours total for all exercizes.

# Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. You can find the instructions for each exercise in the correspondent folder e.g exercise_1 for the exercise 1. There is no particular order to complete the exercises as they are independent of each other.
3. Complete the exercise and follow the expected output format.
4. Create a zip file of all the outputs.
5. Provide the output in a shared location (e.g. google drive) and share the link to your recruiter from ICEYE. 

We are looking forward for your work, good luck :)
