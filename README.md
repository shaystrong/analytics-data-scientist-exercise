# analytics-data-scientist-exercise

Welcome to the hands on exercise for the Senior Data Scientist position in the Analytics team at ICEYE! 

In this repository you will find all the necessary instructions to complete the two different exercises that we ask you to 
complete. 

In case that there is any question concerning the lack of comprehension of the exercise instructions we encourage you get in touch
via email. However, we kindly ask you to please refrain any questions that  have to do with the approach that you 
are taking to solve the exercises as this will be discussed on a later stage in the
interview process if suitable.

We are most interested to assess how you think and present information. These exercises reflect that.

# Instructions
