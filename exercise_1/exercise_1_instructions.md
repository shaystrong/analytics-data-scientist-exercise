# Exercise 1 instructions

Welcome to exercise 1!

In this exercise we want you to use the **exercise_1_dataset.csv** to process, train, and test a regression model. We are most interested in how you approach data curation and modelling. 

In the dataset you will find 29 different features (explanatory features) plus a target variable which is the one that you 
are supposed to model.

Please make the next assumptions while completing the exercises:
1. The dataset has not been processed in any way.
2. Each feature could be extracted from different sensors, sources, etc... .
3. Missing data means there were no data points recorded by the sensors.

## Delivery instructions

The expected outputs for this exercise are two:
1. Your code in the original form in which it was created. This could be a standalone script, a bundle of them or a jupyter notebook for example.
2. A deck of slides or document that should include:
   1. Instructions on how to make your results reproducible.
   2. Explanations on how you got to your results and why you took the decisions you made.
