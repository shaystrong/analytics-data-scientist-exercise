# Exercise 3 instructions

Welcome to exercise 3!

In this exercise you will have to thoroughly read the technical text  **text_exercise_3.pdf** and
synthesize in the preferred document format what the text is about. This exercise mimics
the situation that you would be facing time and time again as a data scientist, where a technical or complex idea, process
or workflow has to be explained to an audience that is not familiar with the topic and that may or may not have a technical
background. Think about your audience as any possible internal or external stakeholder to the product that you are
developing that requires to understand the process in order to move forward and take a decision.


The only requirements are dependent on the type of document chosen for the delivery:
* **Slides**: No more than 5 slides.
* **Document**: No more than one page.
* **Other**: Others format are more than welcome but should be consulted via email (**roberto.llop@iceye.fi**) to agree its limits and length.
